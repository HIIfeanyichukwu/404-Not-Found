## Overview

![screenshot](./img/404-1440px.png)

A responsive 404 page, built for screen sizes 375px and 1440px.
I tried as much as possible to make it as close to the design.

I enjoyed completing this challenge, working with actual design files is quite interesting.

I used google chrome browser for development.
